# grechka_mobile_app
Goals:
•	Develop a mobile app for learning Greek using web-based language service as a base.
•	Provide interactive features for users to practice.
•	In the best case, implement features for tracking user progress.

Steps:
•	Create the environment using Kotlin platform.
•	Add user authorization.
•	Build the data of Greek words, translations, audio, and other needed information.
•	Make a display for the vocabulary with audio play button.
•	Make it possible for users to work with data to choose their list of word.
•	Create some exercises for practice with the chosen list of words.
These things I’ll try to do this semester. If I succeed, I will continue to add improvements and design ideas.

My personal goals:
•	Study Kotlyn
•	Learn to work with multiplatform, create applications and displays.
•	Explore the design ideas
